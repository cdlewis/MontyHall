			<h1>Monty Hall Problem</h1>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>'Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?'</p>
			<p>The name 'Monty Hall' comes from the original host of the game show <i>Let's Make a Deal</i>.</p>
			<h3>Theory</h3>
			<p>The contestant should switch to the other door as it has a ⅔ chance of containing the car whereas the original door has only a ⅓ chance.</p>
			<p>The only time that switching will disadvantage the player is when he initially picked the door with the car. This will only happen ⅓ of the time. Therefore switching will be the optimal strategy ⅔ of the time.</p>
			<h3>Test</h3>
